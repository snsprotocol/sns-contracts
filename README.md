# Sonic Name Service Contracts

A Hardhat-based project for developing Solidity smart contracts, with sensible defaults.

- [Hardhat](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat): compile, run and test smart contracts
- [TypeChain](https://github.com/ethereum-ts/TypeChain): generate TypeScript bindings for smart contracts
- [Ethers](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/): renowned Ethereum library and wallet implementation
- [Solhint](https://github.com/protofire/solhint): code linter
- [Solcover](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage): code coverage
- [Prettier Plugin Solidity](https://github.com/prettier-solidity/prettier-plugin-solidity): code formatter

### Sensible Defaults

This template comes with sensible default configurations in the following files:

```text
├── .editorconfig
├── .eslintignore
├── .eslintrc.yml
├── .gitignore
├── .prettierignore
├── .prettierrc.yml
├── .solcover.js
├── .solhint.json
└── hardhat.config.ts
```

### VSCode Integration

This template is IDE agnostic, but for the best user experience, you may want to use it in VSCode alongside Nomic
Foundation's [Solidity extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NomicFoundation.hardhat-solidity).

If you use VSCode, you can get Solidity syntax highlighting with the
[hardhat-solidity](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NomicFoundation.hardhat-solidity) extension.

## Usage

### Pre Requisites

First, you need to install the dependencies:

```sh
bun install
```

Then, you need to set up all the required
[Hardhat Configuration Variables](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/configuration-variables). You might
also want to install some that are optional.

To assist with the setup process, run `bunx hardhat vars setup`. To set a particular value, such as a BIP-39 mnemonic
variable, execute this:

```sh
bunx hardhat vars set MNEMONIC
? Enter value: ‣ here is where your twelve words mnemonic should be put my friend
```

If you do not already have a mnemonic, you can generate one using this [website](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/).

### Compile

Compile the smart contracts with Hardhat:

```sh
bun run compile
```

### TypeChain

Compile the smart contracts and generate TypeChain bindings:

```sh
bun run typechain
```

### Test

Run the tests with Hardhat:

```sh
bun run test
```

### Lint Solidity

Lint the Solidity code:

```sh
bun run lint:sol
```

### Lint TypeScript

Lint the TypeScript code:

```sh
bun run lint:ts
```

### Coverage

Generate the code coverage report:

```sh
bun run coverage
```

### Report Gas

See the gas usage per unit test and average gas per method call:

```sh
REPORT_GAS=true bun run test
```

### Clean

Delete the smart contract artifacts, the coverage reports and the Hardhat cache:

```sh
bun run clean
```

### Deploy

Deploy the contracts to Hardhat Network:

```sh
bun run deploy
```

```
